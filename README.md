This repository contains a collection of Knowledge Organization Systems (KOS) and related data encoded in [JSKOS data format](https://gbv.github.io/jskos/). The collection is part of [project coli-conc](https://coli-conc.gbv.de/).

## Usage

Each KOS data is located in a subdirectory `$ID` (lowercase short name or acronym) with either one or more of the following JSKOS data files:

* `$ID-scheme.json`
* `$ID-concepts.ndjson`

The files should be generated automatically via a `Makefile`. Its sources such as CSV files should be included as well. Each directory should further contain a brief `README.md` giving a title and links to sources and additional resources such as instructions how to update the data.

Very large vocabularies are not fully committed to the repository.

Script `status.sh` lists all directories and their relevant files (or selected directories passed as arguments).

If [jskos-metrics](https://github.com/gbv/jskos-metrics) is installed, vocabulary metrics can be calculated and stored in `$ID-metrics.ndjson`:

    JSKOS_METRICS=jskos-metrics status.sh $ID

Alternatively run `./metrics.sh` to update all metrics files. Calling `make metrics` will do so and collect the result in file `metrics.json`. This combined file is used for vizualization at <https://observablehq.com/@nichtich/jskos-metrics>.

To re-generate jskos for a given vocabulary, run:

    make -sBC $ID

After having collected, cleaned and converted JSKOS data, see <https://github.com/gbv/cocoda-services#usage>.

## Requirements

Scripts are only testet on Linux. Specific requirements to generate JSKOS files depend on the source format. In any case, the following should be installed:

* make
* [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)
* node and some npm modules (run `npm install`)
* Perl

And for some vocabularies:

* [skos2jskos](https://metacpan.org/pod/App::skos2jskos)
* Python 3

For the usage of python you have to install a virtual environment:

* sudo apt install python3-venv
* make python
